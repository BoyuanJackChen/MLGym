  The goal of this task is to train a model to classify a given image
  into one of the classes. This task uses the following datasets:
  {dataset_docs}

  If a baseline is given, your task is to train a new model that improves performance on the given dataset as much as possible. If you fail to produce a valid submission artefact evaluation file will give you a score of 0.

  SUBMISSION FORMAT:
  For this task, your code should save the predictions on test set to a file named `submission.csv`.
