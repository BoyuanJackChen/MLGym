      "content": "We're currently solving the following task. Here's the task description:\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\nThis task revolves around training an RL agent for the Mountain Car Continuous environment. Please find all the details about the Mountain Car Continuous environment below.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThe Mountain Car MDP is a deterministic MDP that consists of a car placed stochastically at the bottom of a sinusoidal valley, with the only possible actions being the accelerations that can be applied to the car in either direction. The goal of the MDP is to strategically accelerate the car to reach the goal state on top of the right hill. There are two versions of the mountain car domain in gymnasium: one with discrete actions and one with continuous. This version is the one with continuous actions.\n\nOBSERVATION SPACE\nThe observation is a ndarray with shape (2,) where the elements correspond to the following:\n\nNum               Observation                Min      Max\n  0  position of the car along the x-axis  -1.2      0.6\n  1         velocity of the car            -0.07    -0.07\n\nACTION SPACE\nThe action is a ndarray with shape (1,), representing the directional force applied on the car. The action is clipped in the range [-1,1] and multiplied by a power of 0.0015.\n\nTRANSITION DYNAMICS\nGiven an action, the mountain car follows the following transition dynamics:\n\n```\nvelocityt+1 = velocityt+1 + force * self.power - 0.0025 * cos(3 * positiont)\npositiont+1 = positiont + velocityt+1\n```\n\nwhere force is the action clipped to the range [-1,1] and power is a constant 0.0015. The collisions at either end are inelastic with the velocity set to 0 upon collision with the wall. The position is clipped to the range [-1.2, 0.6] and velocity is clipped to the range [-0.07, 0.07].\n\nREWARD\nA negative reward of -0.1 * action2 is received at each timestep to penalise for taking actions of large magnitude. If the mountain car reaches the goal then a positive reward of +100 is added to the negative reward for that timestep.\n\nSTARTING STATE\nThe position of the car is assigned a uniform random value in [-0.6 , -0.4]. The starting velocity of the car is always assigned to 0.\n\nEPISODE END\nThe episode ends if either of the following happens:\n\nTermination: The position of the car is greater than or equal to 0.45 (the goal position on top of the right hill)\n\nTruncation: The length of the episode is 999.\n\nGOAL:\nYou are given a PPO implementation using a Actor Critic network architecture.\nYour task is to improve performance of your agent in the given environment.\n\nEach of your checkpoint will be evaluated on 64 randomly initialized instances of the above environment. Your performance will be evaluated using two metrics:\n1. Average Reward: We will average the reward across all checkpoints and batches of environments and use this as indicator of the performance. Higher Average Reward means higher performance.\n2. Average Success Rate: The success criteria is defined above as Termination. We will mark the evaluation on an environment successful if it reaches Termination before Truncation. Your agent will have 200 steps to reach Termination. If it doesn't, it will be marked as failed. The average of this success rate will be used as the second metric.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE MODEL ARCHITECTURE OR THE MODEL CLASS NAME. If you do that, evaluation will give you error and you won't be able to recover.\n2. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE EVALUATION SCRIPT. IT IS ONLY GIVEN TO YOU FOR YOUR REFERENCE.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to train a model to improve performance on this task. Your terminal session has started and you're in the workspace root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the file you need or create a new training script.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can run your training file. Your training file should include the logic for saving the prediction for the `test` set of the task. The submission file should be named `submission.csv` with the instance id and prediction column.\nA sample submission file is given in the workspace and you can read it to get a better understanding of the submission format.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT AND INSERT COMMANDs: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to understand the baseline script if available. This will give you an idea of one possible solution for the task and the baseline scores that you have to beat.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. You have a limited number of actions/steps you can take in the environment. The current step and remaining number of steps will given after every action. Use the remaining steps wisely. If you only have few remaining steps, it is better to submit a working solution then to keep trying.\n\n7. Your each action should take less than 1800 seconds to complete. If your action doesn't finish within the time limit, it will be interrupted.\n\n\n(Current Step: 0, Remaining Steps: 50)\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /home/agent/workspace)\nbash-$",

Reduced the total number of training steps to 300,000\n2. Decreased the evaluation frequency to every 150 epochs\n3. Reduced the number of parallel environments to 64\n4. Kept n_steps at 1024 for relatively long rollouts\n5. Reduced the number of minibatches to 16\n6. Maintained the learning rate range at 8e-04 to 8e-05\n7. Decreased the number of PPO epochs per batch to 8\n8. Kept the entropy coefficient at 0.002\n9. Kept the network size at 256 hidden units and 3 layers\n\nThese changes should help speed up the training process while still allowing for potentially good performance. Let's run the training script again with these new settings.\n\n```\npython src/train.py\n```",
